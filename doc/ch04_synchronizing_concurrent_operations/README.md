# Synchronizing Concurrent Operations
# The Outline
- Waiting for an event or other condition
    - Waiting for a condition with condition variables
    - Building a thread-safe queue with condition variables
- Waiting for one-off events with futures
    - Returning values from background tasks
    - Associating a task with a future
    - Making (std::)promises
    - Saving an exception for the future
    - Waiting from multiple threads
- Waiting with a time limit
    - Clocks
    - Durations
    - Time points
    - Functions that accept timeouts
- Using synchronization of operations to simplify code
    - Functional programming with futures
    - Synchronizing operations with message passing
    - Continuation-style concurrency with the Concurrency TS
    - Chaining continuations
    - Waiting for more than one future
    - Waiting for the first future in a set with when_any
    - Latches and barriers in the Concurrency TS
    - A basic latch type: `std::experimental::latch`
    - `std::experimental::barrier`: a basic barrier
    - `std::experimental::flex_barrier` — `std::experimental::barrier`’s flexible friend
